# HiveSln
This puzzle is funny, lets play it by using python ...
 
First of all, what is Hive puzzle. In fact, i have no idea what name it is. I bought it very long time ago when I am young in a trip. Obviously it is not easy to solve

Until currently I figured out this puzzle is able to solved by outer 12 blocks first, and in fact, given the 6 angles are found. Whatever it is found accidently or luckily, human brain can solved the rest of the blocks pretty handy. Just a lot of accumulation required.

The rules of this puzzle is simple, any diagonal & adjacent lines sums are equals to 38. And there are 1-19 blocks.
